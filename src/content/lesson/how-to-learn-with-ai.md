# How to learn code with AI using LearnPack?

One of the most important features of Learnpack is that you have a coding tutor right with your code.
You can ask anything about the current exercise, or even solve a doubt that you have with the current technology you are learning.

You example, lets suppose that I'm doing the [Learn Boostrap Tutorial](https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/bootstrap-exercises).

In the first exercise, I can ask something related to my exercise, and I don't need to add a lot of context to the AI, because it is already
being handled by Learnpack.

Our coding AI Tutor has the right context to ask you based in your current code and even knows the result of the tests (if the exercise has tests).
This is an example of how the Learnpack Tutor looks like:

If you are in the right path, it will also give you a friendly feedback and a button to go to the next exercise.

Just use the AI carefully, ask your coding tutor for documentation link to go and read a little more, or ask it something that is not clear for you from the tutorial.

Remember, failling is okay, the only thing is bad is not learning from your errors. 

Keep coding!
