Throughout this course, you will see here and there the word "LearnPack"; you will use LearnPack a lot, so, its better for you carefully undertand what Learnpack is.

## What is LearnPack?

Learnpack is an friendly interactive coding tool that teaches how to make something focused in the idea that you have to make the things by your own.
You can also understand Learnpack as an application to follow tutorials and receive useful feedback while your are coding.

### What makes LearnPack so unique?

Instead of watching a video or reading an article, LearnPack will present small challenges incrementally; each will be auto-grading for instant feedback and a video tutorial solution (sometimes) and an AI Coding Tutor that will guide you in your coding journey.

This is the best way to learn coding-related skills.

## How to use LearnPack

Most LearnPack tutorials will come with a button labeled: "Start new exercise" or "continue exercise".

After clicking on "Start new exercise" a new coding environment will open, and LearnPack will start running immediately in Codespaces or Gitpod.
All LearnPack tutorials come in steps; you will find the instructions on the right side and a button to continue to the `next ->` step. If you are doing the exercise correctly and you ask something to the AI, the AI can also show you a button to go to the next exercise.
